CS205-OPERATING SYSTEMS

Project Title:

Comparison Between Multithreading And Multiprocessing 

OBJECTIVE:

Our project will mainly focus on the differences between multithreading and multiprocessing. The performance comparison will be observed by the implementation of FOUR different series algorithms :

Fibonacci Series
Trag Series 
 Lazy Caterer Series
Catalan Series

INTRODUCTION:

Comparison will be shown on the basis of speed and input (number of elements in the series). All the above mentioned algorithms have been implemented using multithreading and multiprocessing along with the use of pipes.
